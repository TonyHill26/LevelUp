> Oxford’s Department of Physics is partnering with the Institute of Physics to offer a brand new programme of tutoring and mentoring to local school students who want to study physics at university. 

<!--more-->

>The 14-month programme, Levelling Up: Physics, will provide 40 sixth-formers with a programme of dedicated physics tuition from a specialist A-level tutor. The students will also be part of a mentoring programme run by the Department of Physics; students will be paired with undergraduate physicists who can provide insight into what it’s like to study physics at university. In addition, the Department of Physics will be opening its doors to the students (either online or in-person) through a series of visits and events over the course of the programme.

> "It is incredibly important to us to be part of this innovative and collaborative national programme,"" comments Dr Sian Tedaldi who heads up the Department of Physics’ award-winning outreach work. "Inspiring the next generation is one of our primary objectives and this programme is a great example of sustained, active engagement that could make a real difference to students’ lives. We are extremely grateful for the generous funding from an Oxford alumnus too.""
