> **Levelling Up: Maths for Computer Science** has launched at Southampton, Manchester, Birmingham and Bath universities

<!--more-->

We're delighted to announce the launch of **Levelling Up: Maths for Computer Science** in association with the London Mathematical Society (LMS), and the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS).

Computing-related degrees are second only to pharmacology in boosting economic mobility. Students from low-income families are more likely to access such degrees as entry requirements are less prescriptive than other STEM courses. Moreover, the earnings potential for graduates is high and they are one of the surest routes into well-paid tech jobs. A recent survey found AI, IT and Computer Science degrees to be the most valued by employers.

Nearly all high-tariff universities require a good grade in A-level Maths for computing-related degree programmes. Even at institutions where it is not mandated, the majority of successful Computer Science applicants do have A-level Maths. Consequently, it can be a significant barrier to entry.

Working with the LMS, the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) created **Levelling Up: Maths for Computer Science** to address this need. It is aimed at A-level Maths students, from underserved groups, who have an interest in studying computing at university. Consistent with our near-peer philosophy, it is delivered by undergraduates from Computer Science departments.  The BCS removed approximately 25% off the Maths content and replaced it with some excellent Computer Science (CS) material. This work was done in close consultation with the CS departments at Southampton, Manchester, Birmingham and Bath.  The pilot project, involving these four universities, is going well and concludes in Spring 2024.
