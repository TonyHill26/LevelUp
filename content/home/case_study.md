Durham University has taken a bold and ambitious approach to Levelling Up. Right from the start, their Science Faculty has adopted an integrated approach across Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Moreover, they are committed to use this programme as a central feeder into their _Supported Progression_ initiative. In practice, this means that any student from an under-represented group that performs well in the Year 12 component of _Levelling Up_, will be made a guaranteed contextual offer by Durham, ahead of the usual UCAS process.
