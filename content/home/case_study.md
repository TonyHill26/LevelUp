Durham University has taken a bold and ambitious approach to _Levelling Up: STEM_. Right from the start, their Science Faculty has adopted an integrated approach across Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Moreover, they are committed to use this programme as a central feeder into their _Supported Progression_ initiative. In practice, this means that any student from an under-represented group that performs well in the Year 12 component of _Levelling Up: STEM_, will be made a guaranteed contextual offer by Durham, ahead of the usual UCAS process.
