**Supporting A-level students**

**Levelling Up: STEM** nurtures A-level students from underserved groups in Maths, Physics & Chemistry who may be planning to study a STEM subject at university. Combining high quality academic material, with an integrated pastoral programme, it is delivered in small tutor groups by STEM undergraduates from a local university.

**Levelling Up: STEM** provides continuous support that begins midway through Year 12 and runs until the A-level examinations in Year 13. The pilot programme ran from Spring 2021 to early Summer 2022 in Maths, Physics & Chemistry at Birmingham, Durham, Leicester & Oxford. The current cohort (2023/24) has 750 sixth-formers on the programme at a total of 21 universities and this is on track to double over the next two years.

**An ambitious access programme**

The participating university departments are supported, and guided, by their Hub. The Hub is  led by a learned society or a deputising university. In Maths, three learned societies (LMS, IMA, EMS) play a dominant role. For Science, the lead responsibility is taken by a university - Birmingham/IOP (Physics) and Durham/RSC (Chemistry).

**For all UK universities**

Students from underserved groups can be hard to reach. Accordingly, our central principle is that participating universities should intervene close to home and make their own determination of the precise underrepresentation focus. The programme is open to all UK universities. Due to its central role in STEM, there is a special focus on Maths.

**For all underserved groups.**

In addition to the core programme, the first cohort of Levelling Up: Maths for Black Heritage Students started at five universities in England in 2023. [read more]({{< ref "/post/2022-09-28-black-heritage/index.md" >}})
