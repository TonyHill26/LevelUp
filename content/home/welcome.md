We believe that _Levelling Up: STEM_ will succeed primarily because of its high quality. In particular, the core materials and the tutoring programmes are being designed and led by a team of the UK's foremost experts in this area of activity.

Moreover, we note that _Levelling Up: STEM_ is:
 - Well-resourced and builds on existing best educational practice;
 - A sustained enrichment, with clear and measurable goals;
 - Founded on the use of new technology, including Zoom (or similar) and graphics tablets.
