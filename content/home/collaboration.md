Our programme is led, and co-ordinated, by a **collaboration** between the London Mathematical Society (LMS) and the Institute of Physics (IOP), with support from the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). This central hub ensures the quality of all academic material. 

$$ E = m c^2.$$


In our model, the delivery of the programme is through a network of universities spread geographically across the UK. Crucially, in this context, each participating university will focus on students from its region. This will amplify the effect of their existing local widening participation activities.
