Our programme is led, and co-ordinated, by a collaboration between the London Mathematical Society (LMS), the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS),  the Institute of Physics (IOP), with support from the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). These hubs ensure the quality of all academic material.

$$ e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta; \quad E = m c^2; \quad PV = nRT.$$


In our model, the delivery of the programme is through a network of universities spread geographically across the UK. Crucially, in this context, each participating university will focus on students from its region. This will amplify the effect of their existing local widening participation activities. A recent development is collaboration between universities. For example, for Levelling Up: Maths, Manchester, Manchester Met (MMU) & Salford are currently working together as effectively a single university. They approach local schools as a single entity - and also train all the undergraduate tutors together. Manchester is leading this initiative and, in doing so, they are considerably easing the burden of offering the programme for both MMU & Salford. Together, they are supporting a cohort of 100 students. The stated aim of the three universities is to work with all 50 schools in Greater Manchester that have a sixth form.

Finally, although it is our clear intention to run a national programme we also recognise the importance of leveraging existing local partnerships. For example, in selecting students for all flavours of Levelling Up: Maths, our universities will often collaborate with the local branches of the National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE), the Advanced Maths Support Programme (AMSP) and the Office for Students UniConnect.
