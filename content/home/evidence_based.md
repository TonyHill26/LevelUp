Our approach is evidence based. In our pilot programme we sought to understand the successes and challenges faced by students from different backgrounds. We evaluated data nationally by subject, for multiple subject programmes within a single university and for the Levelling Up: STEM programme as a whole. The pilot programme ran from Spring 2021 to early Summer 2022 in Maths, Physics & Chemistry at Birmingham, Durham, Leicester & Oxford.  and, for more details, see the final evaluation conducted by School of Education at Durham:  https://eise.webspace.durham.ac.uk/levelling-up-evaluation/
