For all *Levelling Up: Maths* programmes, students are studying A-level Maths and have indicated an interest in studying on a STEM degree. The primary goal is to help these students improve their maths grade in the A-level examination from C to B, B to A, A to A*. Maths is the core entry requirement for STEM subjects at higher tariff universities (for example, computer science).

More broadly, through near-peer undergraduate tutoring and guest speakers, the programme seeks to inspire students and make then feel welcome, valued and included. Putting it another way, we aim to help make sure they are ready to apply for a place at university, and then to succeed once they are there.
