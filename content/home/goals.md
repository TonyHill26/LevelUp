All the students on Levelling Up: Maths for Computer Science are studying A-level Maths and have indicated an interest in studying on a computing-related degree. The primary goal is to help these students improve their maths grade in the A-level examination from C to B, B to A, A to A*. The overwhelming majority of computer science undergraduates have an A-level qualification in Maths. Many higher-tariff universities make it an entry requirement.

More broadly, through near-peer undergraduate tutoring and guest speakers, the programme seeks to inspire students and make then feel welcome, valued and included. Putting it another way, we aim to help make sure they are ready to apply for a place at university, and then to succeed once they are there.
