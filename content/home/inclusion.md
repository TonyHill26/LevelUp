title: "Inclusion"
---

In simple terms, we are proposing an eighteen-month academic and pastoral intervention that starts midway through Year 12 and continues until the end of Year 13. We will actively target students from under-represented groups. The academic focus will be on Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry and the programme will be delivered through small groups over Zoom (or similar).

Students will have the opportunity to take part in a variety of online subject specific tutorials, mentoring and guest lectures. The overall goal is **inclusion**, as we seek to boost their self-confidence, raise their aspirations and accelerate their academic attainment. Putting it another way, we aim to help make sure they are ready to apply for a place at university, and then to succeed once they are there.
