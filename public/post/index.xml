      <title>Durham University joins the Levelling Up scheme</title>
      <link>https://www.levellingupscheme.co.uk/post/durham/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new programme is a collaboration between Durham, the London Mathematical Society, and the Institute of Physics and has been launched with the support of a generous gift from philanthropist Dr Tony Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Jacqui Ramagge, Executive Dean for the Faculty of Science at Durham University, said: &amp;ldquo;We are proud to be taking the lead in a programme which will impact the lives of many young people in the North East and more broadly across the UK.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here at Durham University we are passionate about helping students succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. We are delighted that Dr Tony Hill&amp;rsquo;s gift will support us to do just that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Institute of Physics joins the Levelling Up scheme</title>
      <link>https://www.levellingupscheme.co.uk/post/iop/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a generous donation from Dr Tony Hill, the IOP is launching an exciting initiative to help widen participation on university physics courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme will provide support to A level students from backgrounds currently under-represented in the physics community, to enable them to apply for, and hopefully be accepted on, undergraduate physics courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially working with three universities and their local schools, the pilot will give A level students both academic and pastoral support through a rich programme of regular tutorials and near-peer mentoring sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this engagement, A level students will build strong relationships with their teacher-tutors, university student mentors and with the participating universities more broadly, as well as enhancing their involvement with physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the pilot, which will run through the academic years 2020/21 – 2021/22, the scheme will be extended to other universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is that students from a wide range of groups and communities currently under-represented in physics will be supported to pursue physics at university and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>London Mathematical Society joins the Levelling Up scheme</title>
      <link>https://www.levellingupscheme.co.uk/post/lms/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a generous donation from Dr Tony Hill, the LMS has started work on a new venture to support the provision of online tutoring for A-level Mathematics students who come from backgrounds that are under-represented in the mathematics community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with three or four universities initially, the pilot aims to bring together undergraduate student tutors with A-level mathematics students who wish to improve their grades to enable them to read a STEM degree. Each university would identify nearby schools with significant percentages of students from under-represented backgrounds and enlist the help of undergraduate students to tutor and engage with their A-level tutees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through enhancing the A-level students’ engagement with mathematics, the Levelling Up Scheme aims to increase the diversity of students pursuing STEM degrees and, eventually, careers. Through providing mentoring to the tutors from experienced teachers, the scheme also aims to enrich the tutors’ teaching skills and knowledge, and improve the foundation on which they build the next step in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
