Each university would identify nearby schools with significant percentages of students from under-represented backgrounds and enlist the help of undergraduate students to tutor and engage with their A-level tutees.\n  Through enhancing the A-level students’ engagement with mathematics, the Levelling Up Scheme aims to increase the diversity of students pursuing STEM degrees and, eventually, careers. Through providing mentoring to the tutors from experienced teachers, the scheme also aims to enrich the tutors’ teaching skills and knowledge, and improve the foundation on which they build the next step in their careers.\n Read the full press release from the London Mathematical Society.\n","date":1596672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596773295,"objectID":"f7e9cd3954166585bab66ba974d26cfe","permalink":"https://www.levellingupscheme.co.uk/post/lms/","publishdate":"2020-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/lms/","section":"post","summary":" Thanks to a generous donation from Dr Tony Hill, the LMS has started work on a new venture to support the provision of online tutoring for A-level Mathematics students who come from backgrounds that are under-represented in the mathematics community.\n","tags":[],"title":"London Mathematical Society joins the Levelling Up scheme","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"557dc08fd4b672a0c08e0a8cf0c9ff7d","permalink":"https://www.levellingupscheme.co.uk/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
